        "\n",
        "In this hands-on session, we will perform causal analyses on a real-world healthcare dataset, known as the *NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS)* dataset. It is a government-initiated longitudinal study designed to investigate the relationships between clinical, nutritional, and behavioral factors. For more detail, please see see the [CDC webpage](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/nhefs/default.aspx/).\n",
        "\n",
        "Our main task is to estimate the average effect (ATE) of quitting smoking ($T$) on weight gain ($Y$). The NHEFS cohort includes 1,566 cigarette smokers between 25 - 74 years of age who completed two medical examinations at separate time points: a baseline visit and a follow-up visit approximately 10 years later. Individuals were identified as the treatment group if they reported smoking cessation before the follow-up visit. Otherwise, they were assigned to the control group. Finally, each individualâ€™s weight gain, $Y$, is the difference in *kg* between their body weight at the follow-up visit and their body weight at the baseline visit.\n",

        "# Our objectives in the session\n",
        "\n",
        "We aim to cover the following:\n",
        "1. Learn how to implement propensity score re-weighting to estimate the ATE in Python.\n",
        "2. Learn how to implement covariate adjustment strategies to estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) as well as ATE in Python.\n",
        "3. By comparing *naive* estimates to what we have in (1) and (2), observe how confounders, when unadjusted, can introduce bias into the ATE estimate.\n",
        "4. Learn how to check whether some of the statistical properties required for causal inference are satisfied in the data.\n",
        "5. Learn how to implement simple and causally motivated decision-making policies on top of CATE estimations.\n",
