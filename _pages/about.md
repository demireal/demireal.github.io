I am a first year PhD student at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu) where I am advised by [David Sontag](https://people.csail.mit.edu/dsontag/) in the [ClinicalML](http://clinicalml.org) group. I am supported by an [EWSC](https://www.broadinstitute.org/ewsc) Ph.D. fellowship at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.

Previously, I got my BS and MS degrees in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/) in Turkey, where I worked with [Cem Tekin](http://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~cemtekin/#) and [Sinan Gezici](http://www.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~gezici/).
